    /*1.
     * How do you make a beeping noise when close to enemy? 
     * And how do you make it repeat faster the closer it is?
     * Check the distance between the two GameObjects
2. Add a sound source to the camera (you could make it looping on the component itself or via code)
3. Upon the distance going below a value trigger the sound source (your beeping) to play
4. Use the distance value to set the audio source pitch (w$$anonymous$$ch w$$anonymous$$ch change
    the pitch & playback speed of your sound effect, I'm not sure how to just change the tempo so the pitch 
    is the same)*/
